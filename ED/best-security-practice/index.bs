# Attacks and Mitigations # {#attacks-and-mitigations}

## Serving user-created files ## {#serving-user-created-files}

The attacker can be an agent with a WebID or an application. They need append/write access to the user's server
to store a malicious HTML file, e.g., because the user allowed them to write a blog post,
or they have their own storage in a different path on the same domain.
 
Impact of both scenarios: The attacker, pretending to be the victim, can access anything
that the victim's account can access.


### Use Solid-OIDC DPoP-bound ID tokens to make authenticated requests

#### Prerequisites

* The attacker has append/write access to a publicly readable folder/file on the server
* The server serves [[SolidOS]] under the same domain (by default, [[Community.Solid.Server]] serves everything under the same domain)
* The victim is logged in via [[SolidOS]], so opening it automatically logs in again

#### Attack

The attacker writes a malicious `text/html` file to the server. When this file is opened by the user:

* It opens [[SolidOS]] in a new tab and saves the window reference (iirc, opening any non-existing resource from the server returns [[SolidOS]])
* [[SolidOS]] automatically logs in, as the user logged in there previously
* The `text/html` file can access [[SolidOS]] via the window reference, including the authenticated fetch
* The `text/html` file can make any requests through this authenticated fetch in the name of the currently logged-in user


### Steal login credentials

#### Prerequisites

* The attacker has append/write access to a publicly readable folder/file on the server
* The victim uses the IDP of the (small) [[Community.Solid.Server]] server
* The storages are on the same domain as the IDP (default for [[Community.Solid.Server]])
* The user saved their login credentials (`/idp/login/` for [[Community.Solid.Server]]) via the browser or a password manager extension


#### Attack: The attacker writes a malicious `text/html` file to the server. Depending on the application used to store the login credentials, the concrete autofill/suggestion behaviour can vary. For instance, if the user saved it with Chrome and opens the malicious file:

* The victim performs any interaction with the site (e.g., clicking on a cookie banner)
* Chrome automatically fills in `<input>` fields for the user name and password with the saved credentials
* The malicious `text/html` file can read and send the credentials to the attacker
* The attacker can use it to login with the IDP of the victim



### Countermeasures ### {#serving-user-created-files-countermeasures}

Servers are encouraged to apply security measures when serving user-created files.
Multiple agents can create files on the same server, which could render same-origin security boundaries useless.
As an example countermeasure, servers could add a `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`
header to artificially enable same-origin security policies for files on the same origin.
